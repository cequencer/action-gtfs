# ACTION GTFS mirror

This allows us to keep the GTFS data from the Australian Capital Territory
Internal Omnibus Network (ACTION) in a revision control system (so we could
look up historical data).

It should be trivial to adapt this to monitor another public transit system.

This is best used in a daily crontab.

You shouldn't need to run this script yourself though, I already provide a
repository at <https://github.com/gtfsdata/action-gtfs>.  It has data starting
from April 2015.
